//TODO
DUPES:

CHANGES:
- Give simple radio consistency. Change recipes so players can access the items earlier.
- Limit parcool. Change default keybinds.
- Add consistency to Corail Tombstone.

CREATE:
- Remove duplicate recipes.
- Create recipes for glassworking products.
- Add consistency between Create and Woodencog recipes.
- Most addon ores do not have a woodencog mixing recipe.

NEXT UPDATE

ADDITIONS:
- Vampirism
- MCA
- VS Clockwork (Prepare for crashes)
- MAYBE look into that butchery mod. There's a few different ones.

CHANGES:
- Add winter forageables for new players. Requires Lychee
- Add Adze module to TFC Modular. Probably wise to update the mod.
