NEXT UPDATE

ADDITIONS:
- Vampirism
- MCA
- Create addons
- VS Clockwork (Prepare for crashes)
- MAYBE look into that butchery mod. There's a few different ones.

CHANGES:
- Add winter forageables for new players. Requires Lychee

- Remove Corpse mod as it is no longer needed.
- Add Adze module to TFC Modular. Probably wise to update the mod.
