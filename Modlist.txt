
The general idea of the modpack is to try and add things into TFC that do not belong in TFC. The general progression of the modpack will go TFC -> Vanilla with a potential endgame reward of allowing the player to go to a vanilla style world if possible. Though datapacks are used for many mods, we will likely still need Crafttweaker for changing the recipes of certain unsupported items and adding oredicts to others. Don't throw your CT knowledge out the window. I'll try to include modlinks next to the mods if possible.
